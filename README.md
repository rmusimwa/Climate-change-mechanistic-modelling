# USING EDITO FOR CLIMATE-INDUCED HABITAT SUITABILITY MODELLING OF PELAGIC FISH IN EUROPEAN SEAS
Welcome to the repository for using the EDITO platform to create Climate-Induced Habitat Suitability Modelling for Pelagic Fish in European Seas.

## **Overview**
This repository provides a TUTORIAL on how the EDITO PLATFORM can be leveraged to create WHAT-IF SCENARIO MODELS for climate-induced habitat suitability of pelagic fish species in European seas. By using ZARR files from the data lake and EDITOTOOLS, this tutorial demonstrates how to simulate various climate scenarios and assess their impact on fish habitats.

## **Repository Structure**
scripts/: Contains scripts for data preprocessing, modelling, and evaluation.
data/: Placeholder for data files. Please refer to the documentation for instructions on accessing the Zarr files.
results/: Directory for storing model outputs and evaluation results.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## **Getting Started**
To replicate the habitat suitability modelling:
1. **Clone the repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository
2. **install dependencies:** Ensure you have R and necessary libraries installed. Use a virtual environment if desired.

3. **Retrieve data:** Follow the instructions in data/README.md to access and organize the Zarr files from the data lake.

4. **Run the scripts:** Execute the scripts in scripts/ to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.

5. **Review results:** Check results/ for model outputs and evaluation metrics.

For detailed information on EditoTools and its usage, consult the documentation.
