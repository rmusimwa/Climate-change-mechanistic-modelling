Welcome to the repository for Climate-Induced Habitat Suitability Modelling for Pelagic Fish in European Seas. This project focuses on using climate data to model habitat suitability for pelagic fish species in European waters.

Overview
This repository contains scripts and resources for conducting habitat suitability modelling using Zarr files sourced from the data lake. The modelling process utilizes EditoTools, a set of functions designed to retrieve and process data efficiently.

Repository Structure
scripts/: Contains scripts for data preprocessing, modelling, and evaluation.
data/: Placeholder for data files. Please refer to the documentation for instructions on accessing the Zarr files.
results/: Directory for storing model outputs and evaluation results.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
Getting Started
To replicate the habitat suitability modelling:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository
install dependencies: Ensure you have R and necessary libraries installed. Use a virtual environment if desired.

Retrieve data: Follow the instructions in data/README.md to access and organize the Zarr files from the data lake.

Run the scripts: Execute the scripts in scripts/ to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.

Review results: Check results/ for model outputs and evaluation metrics.

For detailed information on EditoTools and its usage, consult the documentation.
